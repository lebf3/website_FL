abstract: -<br>Background:<br>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia, is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. AF develops over many years and is often related to substantial atrial structural and electrophysiological remodeling. AF may lack symptoms at onset, and atrial biopsy samples are generally obtained in subjects with advanced disease, so it is difficult to study earlier stage pathophysiology in humans.<br>Methods:<br>Here, we characterized comprehensively the transcriptomic (miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq) changes in the left atria of 2 robust canine AF models after 1 week of electrically maintained AF, without or with ventricular rate control via atrioventricular node-ablation/ventricular pacing.<br>Results:<br>Our RNA-sequencing experiments identified thousands of genes that are differentially expressed, including a majority that have never before been implicated in AF. Gene set enrichment analyses highlighted known (eg, extracellular matrix structure organization) but also many novel pathways (eg, muscle structure development, striated muscle cell differentiation) that may play a role in tissue remodeling and cellular trans-differentiation. Of interest, we found dysregulation of a cluster of noncoding RNAs, including many microRNAs but also the MEG3 long noncoding RNA orthologue, located in the syntenic region of the imprinted human DLK1-DIO3 locus. Interestingly (in the light of other recent observations), our analysis identified gene targets of differentially expressed microRNAs at the DLK1-DIO3 locus implicating glutamate signaling in AF pathophysiology.<br>Conclusions:<br>Our results capture molecular events that occur at an early stage of disease development using well-characterized animal models and may, therefore, inform future studies that aim to further dissect the causes of AF in humans.<br>
